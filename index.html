                <h1>A Tribute to Edgar Allan Poe</h1>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Edgar Allan Poe</strong> was one of the most important fiction writers of America. As a representative of the Romantic School of literature, he started a sub-style of their own, when focused his writings on the fantastic and the macabre. He was born in Boston, United States. And lived from  1809 to 1849.</p>
                <p>He is one of the fathers of the <em>Gothic Fiction</em>, and is also regarded as the creator of the detective tale. As such he influenced generations of writters from horror to science fiction. People like <em>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mary Shelley, H. P. Lovecraft, Sidney Sheldon, Agatha Cristie</em> and so many others.</p>
                <p>Altought a fiction writer, he was rigorous in his technique, be in short tales or poems. These were their main endeavours, as he wrote very few long stories. His tales of suspense and mistery keep readers thrilled all the way to the conclusion</p>
                <p>Another particularity of his work were their characters. While most horror authors put normal characters in a strange world full of dangers, Poe created paranoid and strange characters in a normal world. Much of the horror is psychological, and the only true danger to the characters is the slow descent into madness their strange passion and mania drive them to. Maybe a reflex of their own turbulent life, marked by depression and various tragic events. He died young, and his death is surrounded with mistery.</p>
